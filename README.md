Generates a mandlebrot fractal and prints it into a bitmap image (PPM format) (couldn't be bothered with libpng).

Resolution, coordinates of fractal are set in defines of `src/main.cpp`.
Bounds and max iterations are taken a command line arguments.

There are no dependencies apart from standard library.
